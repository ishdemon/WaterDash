<h3> Why? </h3>
<i>Lets be real who doesn't hates this üòÅüëâ</i>  <br><br>

Jokes aside, traditional systems in market are pretty dumb and not at all smart. It uses a contact based sensor to know whether tank is full or not..<br>
- doesn't tell you how much water is there in tank<br>
- doesn't have App/remote access<br>
- not smart at all<br>

ESP32 also communicates with an MQTT Broker. It publishes all the sensor data to the broker. In my case https://mosquitto.org/ locally hosted in a RaspberryPi. Since my users will just be under 10 at most, i chose to host it local but one can use a Cloud MQTT service if need to handle large users.

<h3>ESP32 Module</h3>

ESP32 board is the MCU that i have programmed to control the pump & collects data from various sensors ( Energy, LPG/Smoke, etc). It communicates with an Android device over USB Serial communication to display all the data. Firmware is written in C++ uisng Arduino framework.

<h3>Android Phone(5.0+) with USB OTG supported</h3>
Android phone maintains a serial connection with the ESP32 board & recieves data (JSON payload) every second. Its a full duplex connection so it also sends controls commands back to the board. I have used a rooted Samsung galaxy S4 with lineage OS to keep it light as possible.<br>

<h2> Features</h2>
1) Calculates Percentage of water in tank(I used Cylindrical)<br>
2) Modes : Auto & Direct(Manual) to cover all the general usecases in typical home.<br>
3) Automatically fills the overhead tank and turns off the Pump based on water availability.<br>
4) Calculates Load(power) connected, AC voltage, current, power factor, frequency.<br>
5) Temperature/ Humidity.<br>
6) LPG Gas leakage alarm.<br>
7) Shows Everything in a cool UI based on Android.

<h3> Pump Protection</h3>
Using Flow sensor in the outlet line of Pump, it detects the waterflow & accordingly switches off to avoid dry running of motor pump.

<h2>Challenges faced</h2>
Since USB will be occupied for communicating with ESP32 MCU, you can't really charge the phone. I had to figure out to run the phone without USB power. 
Tried using a Li-ion charger board to directly charge the battery but it got heated up quite a bit.
Managed to run the device directly without battery by supplying a ~4.4v directly onto terminals. Phone detects it as a battery & it always shows 100%. Great success!

<h1>Older Versions/Prototype</h1>

I started simple with just ESP32 & a relay module to just turn motor on& off remotely. later then iterated & added a ultrasonic sensor to measure the tank level & automated the filling task. Then kept on adding various sensors & an OLED Display to show the data.
